Voltage Note
------------------
If you are running this board at another voltage rather than 5.0V, remember to change this in the SDL_Weather_80422.cpp file:

// For 5V , use 1.0.  For 3.3V (or for ADS1015 or ADS1116)  use 0.66, For Grove Base Shield at 3.3V (required for WeatherPiArdunino but not the Weather Board) use 0.462
#define ADJUST3OR5 1.0
#define PowerVoltage 5.0
